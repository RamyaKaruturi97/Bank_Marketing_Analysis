# Bank_Marketing_Analysis
## Summary:
A marketing campaign is a long-term strategy for promoting a product or service across several
media. It typically serves only one objective, which is to increase the sales of a given product. A
Term Deposit is a deposit that a bank or financial institution offers with a fixed rate (often better
than just opening a deposit account in which your money will be returned back at a specific
maturity time. How can the financial institution improve the efficacy of future marketing
campaigns? A good analysis of the last marketing campaign performed would help us identify
the patterns and find conclusions to develop future strategies.
## Goal:
The main goal of the project is to predict whether a customer will be taking a term deposit or not.
Plan to perform exploratory data analysis, data cleaning (handling outliers, removing irrelevant
columns, dealing with missing and incorrect values, turn categorical columns into dummy
variables), and build a model to predict term deposit subscriptions in the bank. Also, find out
factors, which affect the success of the campaign. We plan to use models like XGBoost,
AdaBoost, Random Forest, etc., for classification and use evaluation metrics like the confusion
matrix, precision, recall and AUC-ROC curve.
